Noted down the encrypted message and the public key from the packet capture.

As it is mentioned in the code that the prime numbers are cached and that there are only 30 of them.

I requested 100 pubic keys from the server using:
for i in {1..100}; do nc vuln2014.picoctf.com 51818 >> keys.txt; done

I converted the keys to integer values.

Then i wrote a script which found the gcd of the captured key to these keys - one be one.

I ended up with 2 prime numbers which were multiplied to get the public key which had been captured.

Then a small program for inverse modulo gave me the decryption exponent.

Again, I used the webpage extranet.cryptomathic.com/rsacalc/index to get the decrypted hex.

hex to ascii then gave me the flag.
