Opened the webpage: found that images are being downloaded using a file_loader.php page.

When changed the image name in the request, I got:
No file at /resources/files/filename.

Inferred that directory traversal attack can be done. Also i knew that the path was /resources/files.

Tried a number of combinations with:
../../resources/files => at this inout nothing got printed. So was sure that I am in right track.

checked source code and found: "/resources/secrets/flag"

Changed URL path to this and got the flag.
