This program requires you to guess a random 32-bit number! Sounds difficult, right? There is a server running at vuln2014.picoctf.com:4546, and the source can be found here.

used netcat to connect to the server.

nc vuln2014.picoctf.com 4546

Input variable number of %d to see the content on the stack.
The format string exploit works because of the presence of
 
printf(name);

in the code.

Ran the program a few times to see which values on the stack were changing. 
After 2-3 trials got the 32-bit random number stored on the stack. 

36911090

which got me the flag.
