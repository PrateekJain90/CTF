analysed .img file with autopsy

searched for strings such as .txt, .png, .jpeg to find any personal files.

found 5 strings which matched jpg. -> meant that the img file had jpg images inside.

used linux kali -> tool-> recoverjpeg disk.img

It extracted some images and one of them mentioned the flag.
