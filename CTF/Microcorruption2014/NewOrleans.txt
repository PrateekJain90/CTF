Put a breakpoint in check_password
Gave input hello
The input password is stored and r15 points to the first byte of the password

Then this address is transferred from r15 to r13
Next r14(initially 0) is added to r13.
The first byte of my input password is then compared to (2400)+r14.
When a character match occurs, r14 is incremented.

This means that the password must be stored at 2400 as each byte starting from that is compared with the password that I enter.
Also, a check for 0x8 in the code tells that the password must be 7 bytes long excluding the null byte.
So, copied 7 bytes from 2400 and that was the password.
