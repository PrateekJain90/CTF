Same as whitehorse.

The only difference was that the input string was being copied to another place.
Then the place where the original input string is stored is reset.

Essentially, conditional unlock is called after this step.

It is the same thing as if the input string was saved at this new location (where it is copied) initially.

Use the same exploit as Whitehorse. Only, the address of the INT function changed. Rest remains the same.
Passed 0x7f after 2 bytes from where I had input the address for INT.
